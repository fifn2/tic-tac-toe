A website where you can play tic-tac-toe against the computer and never, ever, win.

## Getting Started

Navigate to the GitHub Page for this repository (under the Environment tab). You
 should be taken to a page that looks like this:
![
  Welcome!
  Welcome to unbeatable tic-tac-toe by fifn2!
  Your turn will be second to the computer for a while, but that might change in
   the future. Have fun and feel free to look at the source code if you're curious,
    and if you find any issues, or have any suggestions, I'd really appreciate
     you taking the time to tell me here. Without further adieu, press the
      "Start" button below to start the game!
  White on green button with text "Start".

Press the white on green button that says "Start".

### Prerequisites

In order to fully enjoy this, you should use one of the [
  browserl.ist default
 supported browsers
](https://browsersl.ist/?q=defaults).

### Installing

Out of those supported browsers, I reccomend using the latest version of
 [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or
  [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/), which can be downloaded by
   pressing the "Download Chrome" button on Chrome's website or the
    "Download now" button on Firefox's website.

## Playing

Wait for the computer to play it's turn. After it does, you will be able to click
 on a square that says "empty" to fill it out with an O. Wait for the computer to
  fill out its chosen square before chosing your final square.

### The computer's third turn

Due to a nasty bug that couldn't be solved before the April 1st deadline for
 turning this in, this game has to go unfinished for a while.

## Roadmap (what we could do)

* Move the function that controls which move the computer plays to a new module
* Create a 50% possibility for the human to go first
* Make this project my first test driven development project
* Strange twists to classical tic-tac-toe
